# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree -- Dog Breed Classifier

## Project Overview:
This is the dog breed classifier project. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this project, I built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

### File:
* dog_app.ipynb
    * Jupyter notebook container code
* dog.py
    * Refactoring of the code in the notebook above into a standalone python file
* flask_route.py
    * Flask web application that utilizes the standalone python code above into a web application
    
### To run the code:
- jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
- python flask_route.py
