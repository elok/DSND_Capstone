# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree - Dog Breed Classifier

## Project Definition

### Project Overview
Student provides a high-level overview of the project. Background information such as the problem domain, the project origin, and related data sets or input data is provided.


This is the dog breed classifier project. A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is built and trained to determine the breed of the dog. The code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 

We will first create a CNN from scratch and see how that performs and then we'll take advantage of a technique called Transfer Learning.

### Problem Statement
The problem which needs to be solved is clearly defined. A strategy for solving the problem, including discussion of the expected solution, has been made.

how classifier works

In this project, I built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Metrics
Metrics used to measure performance of a model or result are clearly defined. Metrics are justified based on the characteristics of the problem.

## Analysis

### Data Exploration
Features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem have been reported and discussed related to the dataset, and a thorough description of the input space or input data has been made. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that need to be addressed have been identified.


### Data Visualization
Build data visualizations to further convey the information associated with your data exploration journey. Ensure that visualizations are appropriate for the data values you are plotting.


## Conclusion

### Reflection
Student adequately summarizes the end-to-end problem solution and discusses one or two particular aspects of the project they found interesting or difficult.

### Improvement
Discussion is made as to how at least one aspect of the implementation could be improved. Potential solutions resulting from these improvements are considered and compared/contrasted to the current solution.


## Web Application
I decided to build a web application instead of a blog post. I was inspired by the web application in the Disaster Response Pipeline project. I will provide the user with an input button to browse for an image that would be uploaded to the site. After upload, the neural network will be called with that provided image. The predicted breed will be fed back to the user through a flask jinja template.

The web application is split into two main files:
* dog.py
    * Refactoring of the code in the jupyter notebook exercise into a self contained python file
* flask_route.py
    * Flask web application that utilizes the standalone python code above into a web application

During the file upload process, only image file extensions are allowed such as png, jpg, and gif. I also made use of secure_filename() utility function which renames a file if it contains special characters or spaces.

I ran into a few challenges trying to productionize the cnn into a flask application. The first issue was deciding where to put the setup of the neural network. At first, I put it in the main of the file but when the flask application runs, the variables were not scoped properly. Then I tried putting it inside the index route but that meant initalizing the whole neural network everytime the user uploads an image. I ended up initializing the network next to where the flask application was initialized. The thing to remember is when I reference the variable later in the index routes, I have to call "global" in order for python to reference the variable I've already initialized.

The second issue I ran into was the flask site would freeze and crash when I ran the prediction method: inception_predict_breed(). Debugging this issue was nearly impossible because no proper and reasonable error was actually thrown. After some research online, I realized that flask must be run in a non-multi-threaded mode and this fixed the issue. This however, will limit the application to only one user at a time.
